THE JETPACK COMPOSES TRIVIA APP

This app is a trivia app made with Kotlin. Some of the application development technologies and approaches that I use in this project are:

- Jetpack Compose for building dynamic UIs
- Retrofit as a REST client to handle REST API data
- MVVM Architecture to handle separation between user interface logic from business logic
- Dagger Hilt for Dependency Injection
- Kotlin Coroutines to handle development processes that run asynchronously
